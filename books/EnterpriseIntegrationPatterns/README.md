# Enterprise Integration Patterns - Designing, Building and Deploying Messaging Solutions
## Introduction
### What is Messaging System
> The reason a messaging system is needed to move messages from one computer to another is that computers and the networks that connect them are inherently unreliable. Just because one application is ready to send a communication does not mean that the other application is ready to receive it. Even if both applications are ready, the network may not be working, or may fail to transmit the data properly. A messaging system overcomes these limitations by repeatedly trying to transmit the message until it succeeds. Under ideal circumstances, the message is transmitted successfully on the first try, but circumstances are often not ideal.

My own words: *unreliability* of network is one of the limitations, and the *messaging system* is to resolve this limitation
